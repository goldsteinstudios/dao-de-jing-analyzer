## Updated Top 5 Categories by Frequency

1. **Structure** (4,748 - 24.1%) - Foundation layer
2. **Boundary** (2,289 - 11.6%) - Delimitation
3. **Agent** (2,096 - 10.6%) - Human actors
4. **Transformation** (1,453 - 7.4%) - Change processes (無,為,火)
5. **Magnitude** (1,264 - 6.4%) - Scalar operations

---

## Key Insights from New Categorization

### 1. Structure Dominates
**24.1%** of all co-occurrences involve structural radicals (一, 丶, 八, 土, 木). This suggests the TTC builds complex meanings by **composing basic structural elements**.

### 2. Transformation is Central
The new **Transformation** category (7.4%) reveals that 火 (fire) is the unifying element in:
- 無 (absence/nothing)
- 為 (action/doing)
- Other change-related characters

This suggests **transformation is the core operation**, with 無為 representing two modes of it.

### 3. Low Material Emphasis
**Material** category is the smallest (0.3%), confirming the TTC's **de-emphasis on physical substance** in favor of processes and relationships.

### 4. Perception vs. Communication
**Perception** (4.7%) > **Communication** (2.4%) suggests the TTC prioritizes **direct seeing/knowing** over linguistic transmission.

### 5. Structural Composition Pattern
Top 3 categories (Structure, Boundary, Agent) account for **46.3%** of co-occurrences:
```
Structure (foundation) + Boundary (scope) + Agent (actor) = TTC compositional pattern
```

## Remaining "Other" Radicals (8 radicals, 181 occurrences)

1. **艸** (grass) - 51 - in 若 (like/as if) - comparison marker
2. **彳** (step) - 43 - in 德 (virtue/power) - movement variant
3. **女** (woman) - 25 - yin/receptive principle
4. **食** (food/eat) - 17 - nourishment
5. **車** (vehicle) - 15 - transport/motion
6. **臼** (mortar) - 14 - in 與 (give/with) - offering
7. **又** (again/right hand) - 11 - repetition
8. **⺮** (bamboo radical) - 5 - flexibility

These could potentially form additional micro-categories, but their low frequency suggests they're specialized markers.

## Topological Grammar Implications

The improved categorization reveals a **3-layer compositional model**:

### Layer 1: Foundation (Structure + Magnitude)
- Basic elements (一, 丶, 八)
- Scalar operations (大, 小)
- **Function**: Establish base topology

### Layer 2: Operational (Transformation + Motion + Fluid + Constraint)
- Change processes (火, 無, 為)
- Movement (辶, 走, 足)
- Flow (氵, 水)
- Limitation (宀, 尸, 厂)
- **Function**: Apply transformations

### Layer 3: Relational (Boundary + Agent + Connection + Perception)
- Scope (口, 門, 戶)
- Actors (人, 夫, 子)
- Links (而, 丿)
- Awareness (目, 見, 示)
- **Function**: Establish relationships and context

**Compositional rule**:
```
TTC character = Layer 1 (foundation) + Layer 2 (operation) + Layer 3 (relation/context)
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ 19 topologically meaningful categories established
2. ✅ "Other" reduced to minimal (5.3%)
3. → Analyze co-occurrence patterns **between** new categories
4. → Test hypothesis: Structure + Transformation + Boundary = core TTC pattern
5. → Map radical sequences using new categories
6. → Compare category usage in different chapters (1-40 vs 41-81)

---

**Conclusion**: The "other" category has been successfully decoded, revealing that the TTC uses a **compositional radical system** with distinct layers: foundational structure, operational transformations, and relational context. The dominance of **Structure** (24.1%) and **Transformation** (7.4%) categories confirms the text's focus on **building complex meanings from basic elements through transformational processes**.
