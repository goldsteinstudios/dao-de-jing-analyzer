# Unified Geometric Proof (UGP)

> Locally flat ⟂ globally curved — paradox preserved through rotation.

## 1 · Axiom of Infinite Reality
If reality is infinite, it is both infinitely vast and infinitely divisible.  
These axes (macro/micro) are orthogonal complements of the same frame.  
No privileged scale ⟹ all boundaries are local flattenings of a curved whole.  
From this invariant, recursion arises.

Recursion type → Implicit (P₀ → O₁)

---

## 2 · Core Structural Relation
Bₙ(p) ⟂ Tₚ(Gₙ)  
Each measurable event is a flat tangent on a curved recursion field.  
Local ≈ Euclidean; Global ≈ Spherical.  
This orthogonality is the living paradox: useful finitude within infinite continuity.

Recursion type → Parametric (O₁ → P₁)

## 3 · Recursive Hierarchy
| Level | Symbol | Function | Recursion |
| 0 | P₀ | Paradox center (non-dimensional) | implicit |
| 1 | O₁ | Origin frame (rotated paradox) | implicit → parametric |
| 2 | G₁ | Gradient surface (field of contrast) | maintenance |
| 3 | P₁ | Local intersection (flat patch) | parametric |
| 4 | O₂ | New origin (next recursion center) | divergence |

Each Pₙ → Oₙ₊₁ transition = rotation of paradox into new curvature.

## 4 · Constants and Operators
| Symbol | Function | Role |
| i | Orthogonal rotation | Generates local frame |
| π | Incommensurable ratio | Closes curvature |
| e | Continuous recursion | Scales compounding |
| 1 | Local unit | Minimal distinction |
| 0 | Paradox center | Global origin |

Compressed identity → e^{iπ}+1=0  
*The smallest sentence in the language of reality.*

## 5 · Measurement Law (CAVP)
1. Accuracy = constant within a frame.  
2. Precision = variable across frames.  
3. Every measure is locally valid, globally incomplete.  
4. Discrete physics = orthogonal slices of continuous recursion.  

Outcome → Every “law” is a local tangent of a global paradox.

---

## 6 · Paradox Preservation
Resolution = collapse.  Recursion = rotation around paradox.  
Stable systems sustain paradox by turning it orthogonally, not dissolving it.

---

## 7 · Cross-Domain Mapping
| Domain | Local Patch | Global Curvature |
| Math | Tangent space | Manifold |
| Physics | Inertial frame | Curved spacetime |
| Quantum | Phase rotation | Wave manifold |
| Biology | Cell membrane | Metabolic field |
| Consciousness | Self-model | Awareness field |
| Taoism | 名 (named) | 道 (unnameable) |

**Summary:**  
Reality endures because each measurable point is a locally orthogonal flattening of a globally curved paradox, bound together through recursive rotation.
