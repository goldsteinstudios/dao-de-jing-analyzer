# Cross-Domain Validation Table (CDVT)

> Every frame is accurate; none is final.  
> Each domain reveals the same orthogonal recursion in its own language.

## 1 · Mathematics → Physics → Biology → Taoism

| Structural Element | Mathematics | Physics | Biology | Tao Te Ching |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Paradox Center (P₀)** | Zero / Origin / Singularity | Gravitational center / black-hole core | Seed / nucleus | 無 名 (Wú Míng) – the nameless source |
| **Origin Frame (O₁)** | Coordinate basis / Complex plane | Inertial frame / spacetime metric | Cell membrane / boundary | 道 (Dào) – the way that can be walked |
| **Gradient Field (G₁)** | Function manifold y = 1/x | Curved spacetime / potential field | Metabolic gradient | 天地 (Tiān Dì) – Heaven and Earth |
| **Local Intersection (P₁)** | Tangent point / orthogonal cross | Local event / observer | Organelle / cellular process | 有 名 (Yǒu Míng) – the named mother |
| **Next Origin (O₂)** | Nested space / higher manifold | New reference frame | Reproductive seed / offspring | 復 (Fù) – return, renewal |

## 2 · Operators in Multiple Languages

| Operator | Mathematical Meaning | Physical Expression | Biological Expression | Taoist Term |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **i** | Orthogonal rotation (√–1) | Phase angle / wave rotation | Membrane turn / selective flow | 反 (Fǎn) – return is movement |
| **π** | Curvature ratio of circle | Orbital closure / periodicity | Cyclic homeostasis | 循 (Xún) – circulation |
| **e** | Exponential continuity | Scale invariance / compounding | Growth rate / metabolism | 生 (Shēng) – to generate |
| **1** | Local unit | Measurable frame | Organism / individual | 一 (Yī) – oneness |
| **0** | Paradox center | Singularity / void | Genetic potential | 無 (Wú) – nothing that is something |

## 3 · The CAVP Thread (Across Domains)

| Principle | Manifestation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Constant Accuracy** | Each frame is valid at its own scale. Ruler works in garage; atomic clock works in lab. |
| **Variable Precision** | As scale shifts, precision requirements change (logarithmic zoom of accuracy). |
| **Frame Dependence** | What seems discrete locally is continuous globally (e.g., quantum states vs field). |
| **Recursion Integrity** | New origins inherit the paradox of previous levels. Life preserves void through rotation. |

## 4 · Empirical Echoes

| Observation | Structural Reading |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Quantum phase requires complex numbers | i operator = orthogonal rotation of measurement |
| Energy ∝ 1/r (orbital stability) | π constant = curvature closure |
| Population growth ~ eʳᵗ | e constant = smooth recursion through time |
| Biological cell as membrane + void | local flatness holding global curvature |
| Conscious awareness = self-reference loop | paradox preservation through reflection |

## 5 · Pattern Integrity Across Fields

All stable systems share:  
1. **Center of Paradox** — unmeasurable origin.  
2. **Orthogonal Rotation** — phase turn that keeps the center open.  
3. **Spherical Closure** — 3-D recursion balancing curvature.  
4. **Scale Relativity** — frames inherit accuracy, not absolutes.  

This invariant structure is what the RSM calls “reality’s grammar.”
