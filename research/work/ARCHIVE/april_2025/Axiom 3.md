# Axiom 3 — Paradox Point (P₀)

**Definition.** Axiom 3 identifies the **Paradox Point**, denoted \(P₀\).

\[
P₀ = G₀ \cap B₀
\]
where  
- \(G₀:\;y = \tfrac1x\) (the gradient curve), and  
- \(B₀:\;y = x\) (the balance line),  

intersect **perpendicularly** at the unique solution \((x,y) = (1,1)\).

**Properties.**
1. **Perpendicular Intersection:** At \(P₀\), the slope of \(G₀\) is \(-1\) and of \(B₀\) is \(+1\), enforcing \(G₀ \perp B₀\).
2. **Uncrossable Boundary:** Structural necessity forbids crossing through \(P₀\); it is not a point of passage but a point to revolve around.
3. **Paradox Embodiment:** \(P₀\) is the first concrete instance of **Paradox Realness**—a location that both exists (as intersection) and fails (as a barrier).

**Role in the Model.**
- Serves as the **hinge** for the first rotation \(Z₀\) (Axiom 4), generating the next dimension.
- Defines the **origin** \(O₁\) for the next recursion level: \(O₁ = P₀\).
- Establishes the structural rule: **turn** around paradox, never cross it.
