# Axiom 8 — Divergence vs. Maintenance Recursion

**Definition.** Axiom 8 distinguishes the two fundamental **modes** of parametric recursion on any Paradox Sphere \(\Pi_n\):

- **Divergence Recursion** (\(R_n^d\)):  
  Generates **novelty**, branching, and expansion.  
  It continually explores new structural possibilities.

- **Maintenance Recursion** (\(R_n^m\)):  
  Reinforces and **preserves** existing form through processes of repair, thickening, and stabilization.

**Formal Notation.**  
For a given orientation \(\theta\) on \(\Pi_n\):

\[
R_n(\theta) = R_n^d(\theta) \;\cup\; R_n^m(\theta)
\]

**Properties.**  
1. **Complementarity:** Divergence and maintenance are co-emergent; neither alone sustains persistent structure.  
2. **Iterativity:** Both modes run continuously; their balance determines pattern stability and innovation.  
3. **Scale-Invariance:** They apply at every recursion level \(n\), from microscopic to cosmic.

**Role in the Model**  
- Defines how parametric recursion (Axiom 6) both **creates** and **sustains** form.  
- Explains the structural basis for processes like biological growth vs. homeostasis, cultural innovation vs. tradition, and creative formation vs. preservation in any recursive system.
