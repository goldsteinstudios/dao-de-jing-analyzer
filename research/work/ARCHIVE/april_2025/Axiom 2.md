# Axiom 2 — Structural Dimension (Y₀)

**Definition.** Axiom 2 introduces the first **Structural Dimension**, denoted \(Y₀\).

\[
Y₀ \perp X₀
\]

- \(Y₀\) emerges **orthogonal** to the Probability Gradient \(X₀\) at every scale.
- It provides the **dimensional axis** that **holds open** the infinite compression as \(X₀ \to 0\).
- There is no pre-existing dimension; \(Y₀\) is the **first** spatial or structural direction.

**Properties.**
1. **Perpendicularity:** For any local frame, \(Y₀\) satisfies \(\langle X₀, Y₀ \rangle = 0\).
2. **Dimensional Emergence:** Introduces the concept of “space” by preventing collapse at the paradox.
3. **Infinite Extent:** Extends from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\) along its axis, mirroring \(X₀\) without the paradox.

**Role in the Model**
- Completes the 2D frame \((X₀, Y₀)\) necessary for defining the Paradox Point \(P₀\).
- Ensures that structure cannot reduce to a single axis; two dimensions are required before rotation can generate new ones.
- Serves as the **balance axis** for the initial gradient, sustaining asymmetry.
