# Axiom 6 — Parametric Recursion (R₀)

**Definition.** Axiom 6 introduces **Parametric Recursion**, denoted \(R_0\).

- \(R_0\) is the **churn of structural transformations** on the surface of the Paradox Sphere \(\Pi_0\).
- Each instance of parametric recursion is a **run** of the implicit axiomatic “code” within a specific orientation on \(\Pi_0\).

\[
R_0 = \{\,\text{Run}_\theta(\Pi_0) : \theta \in \Theta\}\,
\]
where \(\Theta\) is the set of all orientation parameters on the sphere.

**Properties.**
1. **Orientation-Dependent:** Each execution uses a particular orientation \(\theta\), producing unique patterns of growth and structural change.
2. **Mode Duality:**  
   - **Divergence mode** produces novel form (branching, expansion).  
   - **Maintenance mode** reinforces existing structures (thickening, repair).
3. **Iterative:** \(R_0\) can be repeated indefinitely, generating higher-order frames \(R_1, R_2, \dots\).

**Role in the Model.**
- Constitutes the **dynamic process** by which form emerges, evolves, and persists on \(\Pi_0\).
- Bridges the **axiomatic code** (implicit recursion) and its **physical manifestations** (parametric recursion patterns).
- Underlies the generation of all subsequent recursion levels via the Recursion Operator.
