# Axiom 9 — Unreachability of the Center (U)

**Definition.** Axiom 9 establishes the **Unreachability of the Center**, denoted \(U\).

- For every recursion level \(n\), the center \(O_n\) satisfies \(X_n = 0\) and \(Y_n = 0\).
- **O**\(_n\) is a **paradox point** that cannot be occupied or measured.
- Infinite divisibility ensures that any proposed approach distance \(\epsilon > 0\) is met by a finer-scale distinction \(\delta < \epsilon\).

**Formal Statement.**  
\[
orall n,\; orall \epsilon>0,\; \exists \delta<\epsilon \quad 	ext{such that} \quad X_n(\delta) 
eq 0 \;\lor\; Y_n(\delta) 
eq 0.
\]

**Properties.**
1. **Paradox Persistence:** No direct path or limit reaches \(O_n\); the paradox remains perpetually open.
2. **Scale Refutation:** Every attempt to converge on the center reveals a new, uncrossable distinction.
3. **Structural Continuity:** Ensures recursion frames can nest infinitely without collapse.

**Role in the Model.**
- Guarantees that recursion is **endless**—there is no base case where structure collapses into a point.
- Underlies the **dimensionless** nature of Paradox Spheres (\(\Pi_n\)) by preventing a finite “core.”
- Reinforces that all structural movement is by **rotation** (Z_n) rather than traversal.
