# Pre-Axioms

## Pre-Axiom 0a — Naming Necessarily Divides
- Any designation (“Void,” “Tao,” etc.) is a structural partition, not an action.
- The “Named” and the “Nameless” co-emerge; they cannot exist independently.
- This relation is the structural prerequisite for the first gradient (X₀).

## Pre-Axiom 0 — Void (O₀)
- O₀ is the cancellation of all dualities: void ↔ not-void, everything ↔ nothing, probable ↔ improbable.
- It exists only as a real paradox that cannot be a stable state.
- Void has no independent existence other than as the structural condition necessitating non-void.

## Pre-Axiom 0b — Co-Emergence of Non-Void
- The simultaneity of the Nameless (O₀) and the Named (X₀ ≠ 0) is inevitable.
- The first infinite gradient (Probability Gradient X₀) arises by structural necessity whenever void is “named.”
- Void and non-void are always co-present; one cannot appear without the other.
