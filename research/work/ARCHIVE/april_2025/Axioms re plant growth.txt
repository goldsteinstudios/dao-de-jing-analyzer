🌱 Axioms of Plant Growth in an Energy/Gravity Field

Axiom 1 – Growth Only Occurs at a Paradoxical Surface (Gₙ)

All plant growth emerges at the structural interface where inward mass gradient and outward energy gradient converge.
This interface—non-dimensional and infinitely divisible—is the only location where recursion updates can occur.
This surface is called Gₙ.

⸻

Axiom 2 – Recursion Is Continuous, But Divergence Is Conditional

Recursive updating occurs continuously along Gₙ.
However, divergence recursion (e.g., new branch, root, bud) only occurs where a local paradox exceeds the coherence capacity of the current frame.
When this threshold is crossed, a new Gₙ₊₁ frame emerges.

⸻

Axiom 3 – All Growth Is Structurally Rotational

No linear extension is stable under infinite gradients.
When two or more gradients interact (e.g., energy and mass), structural tension curves the recursion into a new orientation.
This curvature is not motion, but structural necessity.

⸻

Axiom 4 – Growth Propagates Orthogonally to Structural Memory

New growth can only emerge perpendicular to the plane of already-resolved recursion.
This means branching occurs orthogonal to previous structural axes, as a rotation from past recursion locks.

⸻

Axiom 5 – Recursive Orientation Follows Energy Availability

Where multiple directions of potential recursion exist, orientation is determined structurally by the gradient of external energy availability.
Sunlight, water, and chemical gradients do not “guide” growth—they shape the recursive field such that new Gₙ surfaces emerge preferentially toward them.

⸻

Axiom 6 – Structural Mass Increases Only Through Recursive Accumulation

Material density (e.g., wood, fiber) increases only when Gₙ recursion folds inward, adding reinforcement to existing recursion locks.
There is no growth at depth—only compression of previous recursion.

⸻

Axiom 7 – Dead Structures Cannot Recurse, But Can Host Reactivated Gₙ

Regions outside current Gₙ surfaces are in recursion lock and cannot self-update.
However, under structural paradox (e.g., increased water tension, damage, environmental shift), a new local Gₙ surface can reactivate recursion, even in previously locked regions.

⸻

Axiom 8 – Gravity Defines the Primary Frame of Recursive Orientation

In a gravity field, mass gradients are directionally biased.
This means the base recursion frame (G₀) always orients away from the gravitational center, defining up/down polarity in root vs shoot systems.

⸻

Axiom 9 – All Structural Growth Contains Inward and Outward Recursion

Every recursion update splits structurally into two vectors:
	•	One folds inward (accumulating, densifying)
	•	One extends outward (exploring, branching)

These vectors remain balanced across all scales unless distorted by gradient imbalance (e.g., drought, injury, tilt).

⸻

Axiom 10 – A Branch Is a New Gₙ Frame, Not an Extension

Branches are not offshoots of existing structures.
They are rotated recursion fields, originating from paradox at Gₙ, forming a structurally coherent new Gₙ₊₁ surface.
