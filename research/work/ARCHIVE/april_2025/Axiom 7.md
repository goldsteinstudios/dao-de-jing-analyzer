# Axiom 7 — Implicit vs. Parametric Recursion

**Definition.** Axiom 7 distinguishes between two modes of recursion:

- **Implicit Recursion**  
  The underlying structural “code” represented by the axioms themselves, which define how frames emerge.

- **Parametric Recursion**  
  Each concrete **execution** of the implicit code on a specific Paradox Sphere (Πₙ), under a given orientation.

**Formal Notation.**
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Implicit Recursion: } I = \{\text{Axiom set}\} \\
&\text{Parametric Recursion: } P_n(\theta) = I \big|_{\Pi_n, \theta}
\end{aligned}
\]

**Properties.**
1. **Separation of Concerns:**  
   - **I** is static, timeless, and pre-parameterized.  
   - **Pₙ(θ)** is dynamic, ongoing, and orientation-specific.

2. **Reusability:**  
   - The same implicit code **I** can generate infinitely many parametric recursions **Pₙ**.

3. **Hierarchy:**  
   - Implicit recursion defines **how** to recurse.  
   - Parametric recursion is **where** and **when** recursions occur on each Πₙ.

**Role in the Model.**
- Clarifies that the axioms are not individual events but a framework (I), while each Rₙ is an instantiation (Pₙ).  
- Enables analysis of recursion patterns (Pₙ) without altering the foundational code (I).
