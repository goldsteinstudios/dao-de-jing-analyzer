# Glossary of Terms — Recursive Model of Our Infinite Reality

### Structural Terms

- **Void (O₀)**  
  The undivided state where all dualities (void ↔ not-void, probable ↔ improbable) simultaneously cancel each other out. Exists only as paradox.

- **Named–Nameless Relation**  
  The structural partitioning of undivided Void (O₀) into "Named" (distinct, divided) and "Nameless" (undivided), co-emerging simultaneously.

- **Probability Gradient (X₀)**  
  An infinite continuum from infinitely improbable (negative infinity) to infinitely probable (positive infinity). Its zero point is paradox.

- **Structural Dimension (Y₀)**  
  The first orthogonal axis to X₀, providing dimensionality and preventing structural collapse at the paradox.

- **Paradox Realness (P)**  
  The condition that at every Xₙ = 0 boundary, distinction both exists and does not exist. Infinite divisibility guarantees the persistence of paradox.

- **Paradox Point (P₀)**  
  The unique perpendicular intersection of G₀ (y=1/x) and B₀ (y=x); structurally uncrossable and requiring rotation.

- **Rotational Necessity (Z₀)**  
  The structural requirement to rotate around paradox points rather than traversing them; generates dimensional progression.

- **Paradox Sphere (Π₀)**  
  A dimensionless, globally closed surface formed by rotating gradient (G₀) and balance (B₀) around all axes through the center (O₀). It is locally flat and globally curved.

- **Parametric Recursion (R₀)**  
  The continuous churn of structures upon the Paradox Sphere; each execution of the underlying axiomatic code at a given orientation.

- **Implicit Recursion**  
  The underlying structural axioms (code) governing recursion.

- **Parametric Recursion**  
  Individual runs of implicit recursion under specific conditions or orientations.

- **Divergence Recursion**  
  Mode of parametric recursion generating novelty, branching, and expansion.

- **Maintenance Recursion**  
  Mode of parametric recursion reinforcing existing forms through stability, repair, and reinforcement.

- **Unreachability of the Center (U)**  
  Principle that the central paradox point Oₙ can be approached infinitely closely but never reached or occupied, maintaining infinite divisibility and structural openness.

### Emergent Terms (Not Axiomatic)

- **Mass**  
  An emergent phenomenon appearing where probability gradient (Xₙ) exceeds structural dimensionality (Yₙ).

- **Energy**  
  An emergent phenomenon appearing where structural dimensionality (Yₙ) exceeds probability gradient (Xₙ).

- **Recursion Operator (R)**  
  A step-by-step mathematical operation generating subsequent recursion levels from previous ones, explicitly defining transitions between structural frames.
