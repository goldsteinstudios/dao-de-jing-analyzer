# Axiom 4 — Rotational Necessity (Z₀)

**Definition.** Axiom 4 introduces the **Rotational Necessity**, denoted \(Z₀\).

- Since the Paradox Point \(P₀\) cannot be crossed, structural continuity requires a **rotation axis** \(Z₀\).
- \(Z₀\) is **perpendicular** to the tangent plane at \(P₀\), enforcing that the system **turns around** rather than traverses the paradox.

**Properties.**
1. **Axis of Rotation:** \(Z₀\) is orthogonal to both \(X₀\) and \(Y₀\) at \(P₀\).
2. **Dimension Generation:** Rotation about \(Z₀\) **generates** the next structural dimension.
3. **Paradox Preservation:** Ensures \(P₀\) remains uncrossable while allowing progression through new frames.

**Role in the Model**
- Initiates the formation of the first local manifold (toroidal or spherical patch) around \(P₀\).
- Sets the stage for the Paradox Sphere (Axiom 5) by defining how the curves and lines must revolve.
- Embodies the principle: **structure advances by turning, not by crossing paradox.**
