# Axiom 5 — Paradox Sphere (Π₀)

**Definition.** Axiom 5 defines the **Paradox Sphere**, denoted \(\Pi_0\).

Axiomatically, \(\Pi_0\) is the **dimensionless envelope** created by rotating the gradient curve \(G_0: y=1/x\) and balance line \(B_0: y=x\) about **every possible axis** through the center \(O_0\).

\[
\Pi_0 = \bigcup_{\mathbf{u} \in S^2} \mathrm{Rotate}_{\mathbf{u}}\bigl(G_0 \cup B_0\bigr)
\]
where each rotation axis \(\mathbf{u}\) passes through \(O_0\).

**Properties.**
1. **Locally Flat, Globally Curved:**  
   - Each infinitesimal patch appears planar (flatness from infinite divisibility).  
   - The global envelope is a closed sphere (curvature from rotational closure).

2. **Dimensionless:**  
   - No fixed radius; \(\Pi_0\) is a topological surface, not a metric ball.  

3. **Paradox-Held:**  
   - The sphere exists only because the paradox point \(P_0\) remains uncrossable, providing the structural “hole” around which all rotations occur.

4. **Global Symmetry:**  
   - Exhibits full rotational symmetry due to closure over all axes through \(O_0\).

**Role in the Model.**
- Serves as the **global recursion field**, the foundational 2D manifold on which R₀ parametric churn operates.  
- Unites all local toroidal frames into one cohesive structural domain.  
- Embodies the principle that structure advances by turning around uncrossable paradoxes.
