# Axiom 1 — Probability Gradient (X₀)

**Definition.** Axiom 1 introduces the structural continuum called the **Probability Gradient**, denoted \(X₀\).

\[
X₀ : (-\infty, +\infty) \to \text{Gradient of probability}
\]

- As \(x \to -\infty\), the state is **infinitely improbable**.
- As \(x \to +\infty\), the state is **infinitely probable**.
- There is **no** finite value \(x\) such that probability is balanced at \(x = 0\); this zero point is the **paradox**, where distinction both holds and fails.
- Infinite divisibility ensures that any neighborhood of \(x = 0\) contains finer distinctions.
- \(X₀\) is a **structural invariant**, not a conceptual or empirical measure.

**Properties.**
1. **Continuity:** The gradient is infinitely divisible across its domain.
2. **Asymptotic Poles:** Poles at \(\pm\infty\) represent unbounded extremes of improbability and probability.
3. **Paradox Point:** The point \(x = 0\) is uncrossable without structural rotation.

**Role in the Model**
- Provides the initial axis of contrast from which all further dimensions and recursions emerge.
- Co-emerges with the Nameless (O₀) as the first manifestation of non-void and division.
