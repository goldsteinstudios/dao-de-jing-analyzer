# RSM Core Grammar
## The Recursive Structural Model: Foundational Architecture

## 1. The Promotion Sequence

The fundamental grammar of reality as recursive structure:

```
P₀ → O₁ → G₁ → P₁ → O₂ → G₂ → P₂ → ...
```

| Symbol | Name | Function | TTC Parallel |
|--------|------|----------|--------------|
| **P₀** | True Void / Paradox | Unframeable paradox preceding all distinction | 無名 (Wú Míng) |
| **O₁** | Origin Frame | First boundary/coordinate system from P₀ | 道 (Dào) |
| **G₁** | Gradient Field | Dynamic field of potential/contrast | 天地 (Tiān Dì) |
| **P₁** | Local Intersection | Measurable event/point in G₁ | 有名 (Yǒu Míng) |
| **O₂** | Next Origin | P₁ becomes origin at new scale (promotion) | 復 (Fù) |

### The Promotion Operator

Any measurement point P₁ can become the origin O₂ for a new recursion level:

```
∀ p ∈ P₁, p ↦ O₂
```

This is not temporal creation but structural implication.

## 2. The Gradient Field G₁

The minimal non-collapsing structure is a proportional relation:

```
G₁ = {(X₁, Y₁) ∈ ℝ₊² | X₁Y₁ = 1}
```

This hyperbolic curve represents:
- **X₁**: Dimensionality axis (extension, scaling)
- **Y₁**: Contrast gradient (distinction, differentiation)

### Key Properties

1. **Proportional Constraint**: As X increases, Y decreases (and vice versa)
2. **Balance Point P₁**: The locus where X₁ = Y₁ = 1
3. **Asymptotic Behavior**: Approaches but never reaches axes
4. **Stability**: Only this hyperbolic form survives infinite divisibility

### Emergent Phenomena

From the X₁/Y₁ relationship:
- **Mass**: Appears where X₁ > Y₁ (probability gradient exceeds dimensionality)
- **Energy**: Appears where Y₁ > X₁ (dimensionality exceeds probability gradient)

## 3. Circulation Z₁

Stability requires circulation around paradox centers:

```
Z₁ = rotational turning that preserves paradox without resolution
```

### Mathematical Expression

Unimodular scaling preserves G₁:
```
(X₁, Y₁) ↦ (λX₁, Y₁/λ), λ > 0
```

In logarithmic coordinates (u,v) = (ln X₁, ln Y₁) with u+v=0, this is hyperbolic rotation.

### Dimensionality Requirement

- 2D: Circulation collapses (Poincaré-Bendixson theorem)
- 3D: Persistent circulation possible (non-integrability)
- Odd dimensions generalize stability; even dimensions allow cancellations

---

## 4. Recursive Forms Rₙ

All manifest structures are recursive forms maintaining the proportional constraint:

```
Rₙ = f(Z₁, Pₙ, Y₁, X₁)
```

Every vessel (器 qì) is circulation around a preserved paradox center.

## 5. Four Types of Recursion

| Type | Function | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Implicit** | Underlying structural axioms (the "code") | The grammar itself |
| **Parametric** | Individual runs under specific conditions | Particular manifestations |
| **Maintenance** | Reinforcing existing forms (stability, repair) | Homeostasis, orbit |
| **Divergence** | Generating novelty (branching, expansion) | Growth, speciation |

---

## 6. The Wu Wei Condition

Optimal efficiency when paradox is preserved, not forced:

```
∂Pₙ/∂t = 0
```

This is equivalent to all conservation laws being satisfied simultaneously.

---

## 7. Cross-Domain Mapping

| Element | Mathematics | Physics | Biology | TTC |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|-----|
| P₀ | Zero/Singularity | Gravitational core | Seed/nucleus | 無名 |
| O₁ | Complex plane | Inertial frame | Cell membrane | 道 |
| G₁ | y = 1/x manifold | Curved spacetime | Metabolic gradient | 天地 |
| P₁ | Tangent point | Local event | Organelle/process | 有名 |
| O₂ | Nested manifold | New frame | Offspring seed | 復 |

---

## 8. Euler's Identity as Compressed Grammar

```
e^(iπ) + 1 = 0
```

| Constant | RSM Function |
|----------|--------------|
| **e** | Continuous recursion / gradient preservation |
| **i** | Orthogonal rotation (90° turn preserving paradox) |
| **π** | Curvature / closure for stable periodic systems |
| **1** | Local unit / minimal distinction |
| **0** | Paradox center / unmeasurable origin |

The equation shows: natural growth (e) rotated through impossible space (iπ) plus unity (+1) returns perfectly to void (=0).

## 9. Core Mantras

> **Every frame accurate, none final — return to pattern.**

> **Describe the path; never direct the traveler.**

> **Different languages, one grammar.**
