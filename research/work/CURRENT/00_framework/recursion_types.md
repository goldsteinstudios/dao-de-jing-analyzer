# Four Types of Recursion
## The Complete Taxonomy

---

## Overview

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Implicit** | The structural necessity, always present | The "code" that makes recursion possible |
| **Parametric** | A specific execution with orientation | This tree, this ring, this moment |
| **Maintenance** | Stabilizing repetition without divergence | Tree rings, heartbeat, steady orbit |
| **Divergence** | New orientation, introducing novelty | Branch point, mutation, innovation |

---

## Type 1: Implicit Recursion

**The pattern that must be there for anything to happen.**

Implicit recursion is the structural grammar—the rules that any recursive process must follow. It's not a specific execution; it's what makes execution possible.

### Characteristics
- Always present, never directly observed
- Frame-independent
- The "source code" rather than any particular "run"

### RSM Mapping
- The relationship G ⊥ B at P
- The promotion sequence P₀ → O₁ → G₁ → P₁
- The unreachability axiom ∀n, ∀ε>0, ∃δ<ε

### TTC Mapping
- 道 as the pattern itself
- 自然 as "self-so-ness"
- The 道法自然 self-grounding

---

## Type 2: Parametric Recursion

**A specific instance of the pattern running with particular values.**

Parametric recursion is implicit recursion *instantiated*—with specific orientation, scale, and initial conditions.

### Characteristics
- Has definite orientation (this X, this Y, this Z)
- Exists in time and space
- Can be observed and measured

### RSM Mapping
- Rₙ as a specific recursion frame
- Particular values of Xₙ, Yₙ in the gradient field
- "This tree" rather than "treeness"

### TTC Mapping
- 萬物 (the ten thousand things)
- Any specific manifestation
- The 潰→遠 phase of the three-phase engine

---

## Type 3: Maintenance Recursion

**Repetition that stabilizes without introducing novelty.**

Maintenance recursion is the steady-state operation—the same pattern running again and again, preserving structure.

### Characteristics
- Stabilizing
- Low novelty
- Homeostatic

### Examples
- Tree rings (same operation, year after year)
- Heartbeat (same rhythm, maintaining circulation)
- Planetary orbit (same path, maintaining position)
- Cell replacement (same type, maintaining tissue)

### RSM Mapping
- Z (circulation) in steady state
- ∂P/∂t = 0 (conservation condition)
- The orbital that maintains without promotion

### TTC Mapping
- 自定 (self-settle)
- 自正 (self-correct)
- 自均 (self-equalize)
- The 反 phase (wraparound arriving at origin to enable another cycle)

---

## Type 4: Divergence Recursion

**Recursion that introduces new orientation—the source of novelty.**

Divergence recursion is what happens when the system doesn't just repeat but *branches*—creating new frames, new directions, new possibilities.

### Characteristics
- Introduces novelty
- Creates new orientations
- Source of complexity and evolution

### Examples
- Branch points in trees (new growth direction)
- Mutations (new genetic information)
- Innovations (new conceptual frames)
- Speciation (new lineages)

### RSM Mapping
- P → O promotion (new origin created)
- Rₙ → Rₙ₊₁ (new recursion frame)
- Symmetry breaking

### TTC Mapping
- 自化 (self-transform)
- The 潰 (overflow) that begins new differentiation
- 道生一，一生二，二生三 (the generation sequence)

## The Self-Organization Cascade Mapped

The seven 自X operations distribute across recursion types:

| Operation | Recursion Type | What Happens |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 自化 (transform) | **Divergence** | System creates new form |
| 自定 (settle) | **Maintenance** | System finds stable state |
| 自然 (self-so) | **Implicit** made visible | System manifests its nature |
| 自均 (equalize) | **Maintenance** | System distributes evenly |
| 自富 (prosper) | **Parametric** | System generates abundance |
| 自正 (correct) | **Maintenance** | System maintains alignment |
| 自樸 (uncarve) | Return to **Implicit** | System simplifies to enable new parametric |

The cycle: **Implicit → Parametric → Maintenance ↔ Divergence → return to Implicit**

---

## The Tree as Complete Demonstration

A single tree runs all four types simultaneously:

| Component | Recursion Type | Operation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| "Treeness" (the pattern) | Implicit | What makes it a tree at all |
| This specific tree | Parametric | This orientation, this location |
| Ring formation | Maintenance | Same operation each year |
| Branch points | Divergence | New growth directions |

The pith (O) organizes. The cambium (Z) circulates. The rings record maintenance. The branches record divergence.

## Ship of Theseus Solution

Identity doesn't require substance permanence, only pattern persistence organized around an ungraspable center.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "Is it the same tree?" | The pattern persists; the molecules don't |
| "What maintains identity?" | Implicit recursion (the pattern) |
| "What changes?" | Parametric instantiation (the matter) |
| "Where is 'treeness'?" | At the unoccupiable center organizing the circulation |

**Identity is a verb, not a noun.**

The tree replaces every molecule over time. "Treeness" persists because the *pattern* persists, organized around a center that can never be directly occupied.

This is 道法自然 applied to identity.

## The Quantum Vacuum Connection

The quantum vacuum |0⟩ maps to implicit recursion:

| Quantum | RSM | TTC |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Vacuum state |0⟩ | Implicit recursion | 無名 (nameless) |
| Particle excitations | Parametric recursion | 萬物 (ten thousand things) |
| Virtual particles | Maintenance fluctuations | 自X operations |
| Particle creation | Divergence | 道生一 (pattern generates one) |

The vacuum isn't empty—it's the ground state from which all excitations emerge. This IS 無名—the "named nothing" from which all "named somethings" arise.

---

## Why This Matters

The four-type taxonomy explains:

1. **Why pattern persists through change** (implicit survives parametric replacement)
2. **Why novelty emerges** (divergence creates new frames)
3. **Why systems stabilize** (maintenance resists perturbation)
4. **Why identity doesn't require permanent substance** (pattern, not matter)

The ancient engineers watching trees grow, wheels turn, and water flow documented the same taxonomy we now express in recursion theory.

Different languages, one grammar.
