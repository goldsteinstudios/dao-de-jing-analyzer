# CAVP: Constant Accuracy, Variable Precision
## The Measurement Principle of Recursive Structure

---

## Core Principle

**Accuracy** is invariant across scales. **Precision** varies with scale and energy investment.

```
Accuracy = Constant (frame-independent truth)
Precision = Variable (scale-dependent access)
```

---

## Definitions

### Accuracy
The invariant mathematical relationships that hold regardless of resolution.

**Example**: X₁Y₁ = 1 is **always true** on the gradient field G₁, no matter how finely you measure.

### Precision
The degree of refinement in accessing accuracy. Always costly in energy.

**Example**: Measuring X₁ to 10 decimal places requires more energy than measuring to 2 decimal places.

## The Fundamental Trade-off

```
E ∝ 1/r
```

Energy required scales inversely with precision distance. Finer precision demands more energy.

| Domain | Accuracy | Precision Cost |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Mathematics | Digits of π | Computation time |
| Instrumentation | Physical constants | Resolution energy |
| Biology | Neural discrimination | Metabolic cost |
| Consciousness | Attention sharpness | Cognitive effort |

## Cross-Domain Applications

### Mathematics
- π is **accurate** to infinite digits
- **Precision** = how many digits you calculate
- Each additional digit requires more computation

### Physics (Instrumentation)
- Speed of light is **accurate** (constant)
- **Precision** = measurement resolution
- Better telescopes/microscopes require more energy

### Biology
- Sensory discrimination is **accurate** (follows physical laws)
- **Precision** = neural refinement capability
- Higher discrimination requires more metabolic investment

### Consciousness
- Awareness is **accurate** (present moment exists)
- **Precision** = attention granularity
- Sharper focus requires more cognitive energy

## Why This Matters

### 1. Frame Independence
Each frame is valid at its own scale. A ruler works in the garage; an atomic clock works in the lab. Neither is "more true" — they have different precision requirements.

### 2. No Cross-Scale Absolutism
What seems discrete locally may be continuous globally. Quantum states vs. classical fields are different precision windows on the same accuracy.

### 3. Energy-Information Relationship
Information access always costs energy. This connects RSM to:
- Landauer's principle (minimum energy per bit erasure)
- Quantum measurement theory
- Attention economics in neuroscience

### 4. Recursion Integrity
New origins inherit prior paradox without needing infinite precision to do so. Life preserves void through rotation, not through perfect measurement.

## Mathematical Formalization

### The Proportional Constraint
```
Y₁ · X₁ = k (constant)
```

This constraint is **accurate** (always holds). The specific values of Y₁ and X₁ are **precision-dependent** (scale-relative).

### Entropy Invariance
For area-preserving maps T on G₁:
```
h(T · G₁) = h(G₁)
```

Differential entropy is invariant under unimodular transformations. Relative differences, not absolute values, are preserved.

### Measurement Protocol
```
Constraint_Deviation = |Y₁ · X₁ - k| / k
```

This should be < 0.05 for valid measurements within any frame.

## Implications for Practice

### When Observing Systems
1. Identify the **accuracy** (what invariant holds?)
2. Identify the **precision** (at what resolution?)
3. Don't mistake precision limits for accuracy violations

### When Communicating
1. Specify the frame (scale/context)
2. Distinguish between "not true" vs "not precise enough"
3. Use G4 (Empirical Humility): "Accurate here; precision varies"

### When Testing Predictions
1. Energy-precision relationship should hold: E ∝ 1/r
2. Accuracy should be scale-independent
3. Precision should be energy-dependent

## Connection to Falsification

RSM is **falsified** if:
1. Scale termination is discovered (violates infinite divisibility)
2. E ∝ 1/r is violated (precision becomes "free")
3. Accuracy becomes frame-dependent
4. Strictly localized, non-field information is found

---

## The Deep Insight

CAVP explains why the universe appears **quantized** at small scales but **continuous** at large scales:

- **Quantization** = precision limits of measurement
- **Continuity** = accuracy of underlying structure

Both are true. The apparent conflict is a precision artifact, not an accuracy contradiction.
