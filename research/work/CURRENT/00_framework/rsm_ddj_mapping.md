# RSM ↔ DDJ Mapping
## The Recursive Structural Model in Dao De Jing Terms

---

## Core Mapping

| DDJ Term | RSM | Function |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **玄牝** (xuán pìn) | P₀ | The impossible origin — gate that can't exist but must |
| **無名** (wú míng) | O₁ | Origin — "without measurement", pre-projection state |
| **天** (tiān) | Y-axis | Vertical infinite extension |
| **地** (dì) | X-axis | Horizontal infinite extension |
| **天地** (tiān dì) | Coordinate system | The infinite field (兩儀, the two poles) |
| **天下** (tiān xià) | Bounded region | Where 萬物 manifest within the system |
| **萬物** (wàn wù) | Instances | Parametric expressions at specific coordinates |
| **大** (dà) | Infinity | The unbounded field |
| **反** (fǎn) | Wraparound | Spherical topology — infinite extension arrives at origin from opposite direction |

---

## The Non-Temporal Paradox

### What O₁ Is NOT

O₁ is **not** a starting point that then becomes everything.

| Cosmological Model | RSM |
|-------------------|-----|
| Singularity → Big Bang → Everything | Linear, temporal, has a "start" |
| O₁ ↔ 萬物 | Simultaneous, paradox, no sequence |

### What O₁ IS

O₁ is the paradox condition — no beginning, no end, always already both singular and infinite. The singularity that never "banged."

The 玄牝 / O₁ / 無名 isn't BEFORE 萬物 in time. It's the **condition** for 萬物 — always present, always generative, never separate.

```
NOT:  O₁ ──then──> 天地 ──then──> 萬物

BUT:  O₁ ⟷ 天地 ⟷ 萬物  (simultaneous, mutual)
```

## Chapter-by-Chapter Encoding

### Chapter 6: The Origin

> 玄牝之門，是謂天地根

| Term | RSM | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| 玄牝 | P₀ | Impossible origin |
| 門 | — | Gate (the interface) |
| 天地根 | O₁ | Root of coordinate system |

**玄牝之門** is P₀ — the gate that can't exist but must. It's the ROOT of 天地 (the coordinate system), not the root of physical reality.

### Chapter 25: The Sphere Proof

> 道大：大曰潰，潰曰遠，遠曰反

| Term | RSM | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| 道大 | Header | "Pattern of infinity:" |
| 大 | ∞ | Unbounded field |
| 潰 | Overflow | From 玄牝, expands everywhere |
| 遠 | Extension | Infinite in all directions |
| 反 | Wraparound | Arrives at origin from opposite direction |

The sphere proof: infinite extension in all directions wraps around to origin.

### Chapter 42: The Generation Sequence

> 道生一。一生二。二生三。三生萬物。

| Term | RSM | What It Is |
|------|-----|------------|
| 道 | P₀ → O₁ | Pattern (玄牝 through 無名) |
| 一 | O₁ | Unity (origin point) |
| 二 | X, Y | Two axes (天, 地) |
| 三 | X, Y + 沖氣 | The interaction they create |
| 萬物 | Instances | All bounded forms |

**沖氣** (rushing/blending breath) = what happens when the two infinite axes interact.

This isn't temporal history — it's **logical dependency**.

---

## The Four Infinities

### 故道大，天大，地大，王亦大

| Term | Frame | RSM |
|------|-------|-----|
| 道大 | Pattern | The unbounded field itself |
| 天大 | Heaven | Y-axis infinite |
| 地大 | Earth | X-axis infinite |
| 王亦大 | Conscious agent | Observer infinity |

**域中有四大，而王居其一焉**

The 王 isn't observing from outside — the 王 IS one of the four infinite frames. The observer participates in what it observes.

---

## The Recursion Cascade

### 人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然

| Frame | Recurses Within |
|-------|-----------------|
| 人 | 地 |
| 地 | 天 |
| 天 | 道 |
| 道 | 自然 |

**法 = recurses within** (not "follows" or "models")

Each frame operates within the constraints of the frame that contains it. At the deepest level, 道法自然 — pattern recurses within its own nature. No external reference. Self-grounding.

---

## Structure Creates Void

### The Whirlpool Principle

The structure doesn't expand INTO pre-existing room — **it creates the space it expands into by turning the infinite field into a held void**.

| Analogy | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Whirlpool | Spinning water creates void at center |
| Room | Walls hold void open |
| 無 | Structure creates by holding open |

**無 isn't pre-existing room. 無 is what happens when structure creates space by its own operation.**

### 為無為

| Traditional | Structural |
|-------------|------------|
| "Act without acting" | "Enact the void-creating operation" |

---

## Key Principles

1. **No temporal sequence** — Generation is logical dependency, not history

2. **Observer participation** — 王 is one of the four infinities, not external to them

3. **Structure creates void** — 無 is held open by structure, not pre-existing

4. **Spherical topology** — Infinite extension wraps around (反 = wraparound, not reversal)

5. **Self-grounding** — 道法自然 means pattern recurses within itself, no external reference
