## Quick Reference

### Core Sequence
```
P₀ → O₁ → G₁ → P₁ → O₂
```

### Gradient Field
```
G₁ = {(X₁, Y₁) | X₁Y₁ = 1}
```

### Operators
```
i = orthogonal rotation
π = curvature closure
e = scale recursion
1 = local unit
0 = paradox center
```

### Guardrails
- G1: No privileged frame
- G2: Preserve paradox
- G3: Translate cross-domain
- G4: Empirical humility
- G5: Invitation > Assertion
- G6: Non-prescriptive mode

### Mantras
> Every frame accurate, none final — return to pattern.

> Describe the path; never direct the traveler.

> Different languages, one grammar.
