# Dao De Jing Pattern Analysis Tool

A structural translation project treating the Dao De Jing as geometric notation rather than mystical poetry. Validated against the Guodian bamboo slip manuscripts (~300 BCE).

## Project Overview

This project decodes the Dao De Jing as technical documentation encoding:
- **Geometric recursion**: O→G→P→O cycles (origin → gradient → periphery → new origin)
- **Transformation algebra**: Characters as equations where radicals are operands
- **The π-operation**: 曲則全 (curving completes) - the scythe principle

## Key Discoveries

### The Scythe-Not-Knife Distinction
利 (lì) = 禾 (grain) + 刂 (blade) = **scythe arcing through field**, NOT knife cutting.
- You cannot harvest a field with a knife (linear push, one stalk at a time)
- You harvest with a scythe (arc sweep, field cleared)
- This is 無為 in action: the arc that completes what straight lines cannot

### The Rosetta Stone (Chapter 25)
道大 → 逝 → 遠 → 反
(pattern-as-field → extends → boundary → returns)

This maps to Euler's identity: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0

### The Subtraction Principle (Chapter 48)
- 為學日益 (practicing learning: daily increase) → no limit
- 為道日損 (practicing pattern: daily decrease) → arrives at 無為

### The 無為 Definition (Chapter 64)
輔萬物之自然，而不敢為
"Assist all things' self-so-ness, not daring to impose"

## Translations Corpus

**35 chapters translated** with:
- Character-by-character decomposition
- Radical algebra (substrate + operator → result)
- Guodian manuscript validation (~300 BCE)
- Cross-references to related chapters

### Core Structural Chapters
| Chapter | Content | Key Formula |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Coordinate system | 可/常, 無/有, 妙/徼 axes |
| 11 | Void/function | 有之以為利，無之以為用 |
| 22 | π-operation | 曲則全 (curving completes) |
| 25 | Recursion cycle | 道大→逝→遠→反 |
| 48 | Subtraction | 損之又損以至於無為 |
| 64 | 無為 definition | 輔萬物之自然 |

## Structural Lexicon

Six-part reference documenting characters as transformation equations:

1. **Substrate Families** - What receives operations (禾, 氵, 心, 貝, 木, 土)
2. **Operator Families** - What transforms substrates (刂, 口, 反, 彳)
3. **Structural Positions** - The coordinate system (無/有, 可/常, etc.)
4. **Concept Index** - Cross-reference by operational principle
5. **Pinyin Index** - Alphabetical lookup

## Archaeological Validation

Guodian bamboo slips (~300 BCE) confirm:
- 若 appearance operator
- 反/弱 oscillation engine
- 玄同 boundary formula
- 自然/自化 self-organization terms
- 恆 (constant) as original form of 常

See `translations/archaeology/` for complete inventory of Bundles A, B, C.

## Web Application

Interactive visualization tool for pattern analysis:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Features:
- Character grid (9,000+ characters across 81 chapters)
- Radical highlighting system
- Co-occurrence matrix
- Search and navigation
