TEST 7: 禾 (GRAIN RADICAL) TRANSFORMATION ALGEBRA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

VALIDATED PATTERN: Substrate + Operation → Result

SUBSTRATE: 禾 (grain field) = distributed resource domain

OPERATIONS ENCODED:

1. 利 = 禾+刀 → CUTTING (constraint/paths)
2. 和 = 禾+口 → DISTRIBUTING (harmony/flow)
3. 私 = 禾+厶 → ISOLATING (privatization)
4. 稱 = 禾+爯 → MEASURING (quantification)
5. 穀 = 禾+殼 → CONTAINING (preservation)
6. 稷 = 禾+畟 → SANCTIFYING (elevation)
7. 秀 = 禾+乃 → DISPLAYING (prominence)
8. 秋 = 禾+火 → COMPLETING (harvest)
9. 季 = 禾+子 → SEQUENCING (temporal order)
10. 委 = 禾+女 → YIELDING (delegation)

CONCLUSION:
✓ Characters encode TRANSFORMATIONS not virtues
✓ Same substrate, different operations = function family
✓ The radical system IS the type system
✓ Character construction = function composition

利 = f(禾, 刀) = "paths cut through field"
NOT "benefit" or "advantage"

This validates RSM's geometric reading approach.
