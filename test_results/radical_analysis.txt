KEY CHARACTER RADICAL BREAKDOWNS - STRUCTURAL VALIDATION

常 (cháng) - "implicit/frame-independent"
  Radicals: 巾 (cloth) + 尚 (still/yet above)
  Geometric reading: Cloth = covering/concealment (that which isn't shown)
  + still/elevated = persistent hidden structure
  VALIDATES: "implicit" (not visible in frame)

欲 (yù) - "orientation/observational stance"
  Radicals: 谷 (valley) + 欠 (lack/opening/yawn)
  Geometric reading: Valley = directional container
  + opening/lack = directed void (where attention points)
  VALIDATES: "orientation" (directed emptiness)

利 (lì) - "constraint/conditions/path-cutting"
  Radicals: 禾 (grain) + 刀 (knife)
  Geometric reading: Grain cut with knife = boundary established
  Knife creates conditions by separating
  VALIDATES: "constraint" NOT "benefit"

仁 (rén) - "relational accommodation"
  Radicals: 人 (person) + 二 (two)
  Geometric reading: One entity + duality = space between two
  The relational field that emerges when positions interact
  VALIDATES: "between-space accommodation" NOT "benevolence"

反 (fǎn) - "reversal/oscillation"
  Radicals: 又 (hand/again) + 厂 (cliff/slope)
  Geometric reading: Hand against boundary = bouncing back
  Action meeting resistance and reversing
  VALIDATES: "oscillation/reversal" (P→O operator)

弱 (ruò) - "soft/yielding/indefinite"
  Radicals: 弓 (bow) + 弓 (bow) [two弓components]
  Geometric reading: Double bow = flexible, not rigid
  Capacity to bend without breaking (maintains superposition)
  VALIDATES: "indefiniteness/softness" NOT "weakness"

生 (shēng) - "co-generation/mutual arising"
  Radicals: 土 (earth) + 一 (one/line)
  Geometric reading: Something emerging from ground level
  Simultaneous emergence, not sequential causation
  VALIDATES: "co-generation" NOT "birth/create"

玄 (xuán) - "paradoxical origin point"
  Radicals: 玄 is itself a primitive (silk threads from cocoon)
  Geometric reading: Dark/mysterious intertwined origin
  The (0,0,0) point where axes converge
  VALIDATES: "origin point" NOT just "mysterious"

名 (míng) - "framed distinction"
  Radicals: 夕 (evening) + 口 (mouth)
  Geometric reading: Mouth in darkness = calling out boundaries
  Creating explicit labels in implicit space
  VALIDATES: "framed distinction" (state, not act)
