TEST 6: 利 (LÌ) DISTRIBUTION & CO-OCCURRENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINDINGS:
• Total occurrences: 10 across 9 chapters
• Highest density: Chapter 35 (2 occurrences)
• Also appears in: 6, 7, 16, 20, 43, 44, 46, 48

CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS:
• 利 and 用 do NOT co-occur closely in bamboo slip version
• This differs from received text (Wang Bi) Chapter 11
• Most common nearby characters: 之, 其, 道, 義, 玄

IMPLICATION:
The famous "有之以為利，無之以為用" may be a later addition
or appears in different location in earlier manuscripts.

The structural reading (利 = constraint/path-cutting) still holds
independent of its pairing with 用.
